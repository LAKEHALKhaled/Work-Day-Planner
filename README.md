# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

We created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

WHEN we open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN we scroll down we find a timeblocks for standard business hours
THE timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN we click into a timeblock we can enter an event
WHEN we click the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN we refresh the page the saved events persist
